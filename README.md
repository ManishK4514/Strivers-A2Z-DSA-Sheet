This Sheet is made for people who want to learn DSA from A to Z for free in a well-organized and structured manner by Raj Vikramaditya(Striver Bhaiya) & their Take You Forward Team. 

There might be a lot of existing sheets in the market, but this is better in terms of structure, and the number of questions we will be doing. We just don’t teach the basics, we cover all the varieties, and we go in super depth for each topic, so that you are well prepared for any of your interviews.
